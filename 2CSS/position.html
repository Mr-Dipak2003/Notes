<!-- The position property in CSS tells about the method of positioning for an element or an HTML entity 
and the positioning of an element can be done using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.

There are five different types of position properties available in CSS:

Fixed:-	An element with position: fixed property remains in the same position relative to the viewport even when the page is scrolled.
Static:-Default positioning method. Elements with position: static are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
Relative:-Elements with position: relative are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow. Other elements will not fill the gap left by this element when adjusted.
Absolute:-Positioned concerning its nearest non-static ancestor. Elements with position: absolute are taken out of the normal document flow.
Sticky:-Combines features of position: relative and position: fixed. The element is treated as position: relative until it reaches a specified threshold, then it becomes position: fixed. -->
